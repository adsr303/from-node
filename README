FromNode
========

This is a Ruby module that maps XPaths under an XML node to members of
a class. The purpose is to allow the developer to use simple definitions
in case of a non-trivial value to member mapping, e.g. when member names
are different than attribute names or an object is represented by a
nested XML structure.
